# Workout Routine Builder

This project was created with the idea of having a centralized place to view and create workout routines. The user is able to add routines then fill them with exercises picked from a list.

## Technologies

The server is built with Ruby on Rails connected to a PostgreSQL database. The models are Exercise and Routine joined by a third model Workouts in a many-to-many relationship.

## Future Goals

The goals for the server-side are limited as I was able to get the back end up and running relatively quickly. Any changes that I make will be hinged on the future goals of the front end and if I need to make changes to the database because of a new feature that I want on the client-side
